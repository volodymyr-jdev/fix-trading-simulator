# Overview

A trading simulator between a Broker and a Stock Exchange using the [Financial Information eXchange (FIX) Protocol](https://www.fixtrading.org/). It's a study project using [QuickFIX/J](https://www.quickfixj.org/), [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), Docker, Docker Compose and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

If you want to participate on this project, just open an issue and we can talk about!

Both Broker and Exchange systems were built with Quarkus on the back-end and Angular on the front-end.

The back-ends communicate each other with QuickFIX/J and each has a schema into the PostgreSQL.

Each Angular front-end communicates with the Quarkus back-end using REST and Websockets.

# Features

## Orders

You can submit, negotiate, cancel and list your orders.

It's possible to set the Exchange to automatically negotiate the orders.

Every change in the orders are broadcasted using websockets and are imeaditelly updated on the front-end.

## Session

Make logon and logout.

View the session status and storage.

View the session configuration.

List the messages sent from the session.

## Logs

List the FIX events.

List the messages received and sent.


# Running the project

After start, access project at:
- Broker Front end
  - http://localhost:8085/
- Broker Back end swagger:
  - http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui/
- Exchange Front end
  - http://localhost:8095/
- Exchange Back end swagger:
  - http://localhost:8090/q/swagger-ui/
- PostgreSQL:
  - jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres
  - user: postgres
  - password: postgres

The containers should be running like this:
```
docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES

```
### Standard Mode (JVM)

This mode is suitable for development, debugging, and general use. It compiles and runs Java applications inside a
standard OpenJDK container. Crucially, by leveraging Multi-stage Docker builds, this allows the images to be compiled
entirely from source without requiring local installations of Java, Maven, Node.js, or Angular CLI on your machine.

**Files used:** 
`./run-project.sh` and `docker-compose.yml`.

**Startup Command:**
```
$ chmod +x ./run-project.sh 
$ ./run-project.sh
```

### Native Image Mode (Instant Startup)

This mode compiles the Quarkus backends into fast, standalone native executables using GraalVM (Mandrel). Native
executables offer microsecond startup times and a significantly lower memory footprint, making them ideal for production
or minimal environments. The process leverages Multi-stage Docker builds, allowing the images to be compiled entirely
from source without requiring local installations of Java, Maven, Node.js, or Angular CLI.

**Files used:**
`./run-project-native.sh` and `docker-compose-native.yml`.

**Startup Command:**
```
$ chmod +x ./run-project-native.sh 
$ ./run-project-native.sh
```
**Prerequisites:** Ensure your Docker environment is allocated sufficient resources (8GB+ RAM recommended for the compilation stage).

### Using the Docker Hub Images

Inside the root folder of the project, execute:
```
$ chmod +x ./run-from-docker-hub.sh
$ ./run-from-docker-hub.sh
```

Docker Hub images:
- [exchange-back-end](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/felipewind/exchange-back-end)
- [exchange-front-end](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/felipewind/exchange-front-end)
- [broker-back-end](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/felipewind/broker-back-end)
- [broker-front-end](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/felipewind/broker-front-end)

## Development Mode (Manual Setup)

> **Note:** This section is intended for **developers** who want to modify the source code and use features like **Live Coding / Hot Reload**.
>
> Unlike the Docker method, this mode **REQUIRES** you to install Java 11+, Maven, Node.js, and Angular CLI on your local machine.

The default version of the development back-end projects is using H2 data base (in memory).

It's possible to change the `application.properties` and set them to run with PostgreSQL, in this case you should start a PostgreSQL container:
```
docker run -d --name postgres-qfj -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=postgres postgres
```


### Enter inside the `exchange-back-end` folder and type:
```
$ ./mvnw compile quarkus:dev -Ddebug=5006
```

Access http://localhost:8090/q/swagger-ui/

### Enter inside the `broker-back-end` folder and type:
```
$ ./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

Access http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui/


### Enter inside the `exchange-front-end` folder and type:
```
$ npm install
$ ng serve
```

Access http://localhost:4300


### Enter inside the `broker-front-end` folder and type:
```
$ npm install
$ ng serve
```

Access http://localhost:4200
